# Huawei koollabs exercises in Big Data
## What Is KooLabs?
KooLabs is Huawei Cloud's official lab platform, where lab environments can be launched in a single click. Following the lab guide, developers can quickly get started with Huawei Cloud services and implement, debug, and verify them on the cloud.
## Exercises Overview
The repository is divided into multiple exercises, each one focuses on a specific Big Data app:
## What is HDFS?
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System.
HDFS operates as a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware.
HDFS is fault-tolerant and designed to be deployed on low-cost, commodity hardware.
### HDFS Data and Files（CRUD）
This exercise describes how to use the command-line interface (CLI) provided by Hadoop to add, delete, modify, and query HDFS data and files.
### HDFS File Write
Use Python to upload data to a specified HDFS. 
### HDFS File Read
Use Python to read data from specified HDFS. 
## What is HBase?
HBase is a distributed, scalable, big data store. Use Apache HBase when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data.
It is supporting NoSQL databases that store data in a non-tabular format.
### Basic Operations on HBase Data
This exercise describes how to use HBase Shell commands to create, delete, modify the user_tag_value table, as well as add, delete, query, and modify table data.
